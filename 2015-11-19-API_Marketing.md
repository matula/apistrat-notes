# Marketing in the API Space

## Thursday Bram 

Is API a marketing tool, product, etc? Depends.

- IFTTT - 600M recipes per month, across 170 channels

Marketing should be invisible. Baked-in to what you're doing.

Best marketing tool for API is documentation.  Constantly searched and read.

* Market your API changes.
* Hackathons 
	* Have Dev Evangelist to help
	* Market/use the apps built
* Niche Users 
	* Code school students
	* other users outside what you expect

Marketing and Development never end.  Work together and it becomes more manageable.

API Content Marketing

There is no "developer marketing", it's just helping. 
* share knowledge, not features

You should blog more. Easiest tool to reach customers and potential.

Know your audience. Know their problem(s).

*What kind of API?*
* Service enhanced by an API
* Company IS the API

### Blogging
* Someone has to "own" it. Champion it / Be its spark.

**How do you staff it?**

Team of writers, one full-time, just you

**How do you make people write?**

You don't. Show them the value.  Find outside help.

**Editorial Calendar**

* How many posts per _____ (day/week/month)?
* Trello, Spreadsheet, etc.
	* calendar is visible
	* soecific
	
**Types of posts**

* think piece
* how we work
* round up of tools
* tutorials - best place to start for sharing knowledge
	* sample apps
	* demos
	* click-to-cloud
	* getting started guides
* Use cases
* documentation

### Beyond the blog

* whitepapers
* ebooks
* webinars
* video

Many types of content. But don't call it content - "tutorial, walk through, etc"

## Personas for your API - Kristen Womack

**What are personas?**

Bring your customers to life.

attitudes/values/beliefs -- motivations --- flow of day: find the intersection.

Focus on users.

Your API isn't just a spec.  There are real users to think about
	* How long to wait for API key
	* what do you mean "rate limit"
	* docs

API heirarchy of needs

creativity ->  proficiency -> reliability -> functionality -> usability
