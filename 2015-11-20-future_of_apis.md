# Future of APIs - Dion Hinchcliffe

Consumer APIS vs Business APIs.  Business APIs are more difficult to get adoption.

Nordstrom - using APIs as a business strategy  (see Harvard Business Review)

> "Persistent digitalization of Nordstrom business allowed revenue growth more than 50%"

### Why you can't get there

* can't allow the time to make it mature
* every part of the org, all teams are in the API business

APIs are gateway to next-gen tech

* mobile
* IoT
* big data

currently, 10-12 thousand of open APIs

Every non-trivial object is about to get an API

Business of API is major force.  Expedia, 90% of rev from API. Ebay, 60%. Amazon, 8% but half of total profit.

API business models have matured.

* developer pays - AWS, Paypal
* developer gets paid - Revshare, affiliate

APIS have led to most complex operation landscape in tech history

API space will become highly competative in the near future.  Still open today.  

"low code" enabled by simple APIs.  ie IFTTT.

APIs enable citizen developers.  Will probably be the lion share of API usage

### next 36 months

* 10 to 100 times more data and apps
* 10 times of experiments to win, 100 time to own industry
* 5-10 times more integration - enable citizen devs
* You can't do it yourself - talk to customer
* Let the "developer network" do the work.  Listen to devs/consumers.

We're in the "cave painting" days of APIs. A great future ahead.
