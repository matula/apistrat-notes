# APIs in the Enterprise

## How Walgreens Formed it's digital business

Mobile traffic share 2014: 60%

Multichannel customers spend 3.5-6x more than store-only customers

### Api Strategy

* Reimagine - through mobile solutions
* Extend

Awareness, Innovation, Revenue, Traffic - the heart of "Extend"

Photos...
* classic - bring to store, wait for processing
* web - order online
* mobile - send mobile photos through app

Balance Rewards API 

Prescription API - refill by scanning through app

* Refill existing prescriptions
* Transfer to walgreens
* integration with Glow and WebMD

### Reaching out 

YouTube, StackOverflow, Github, RSS 

Use Basecamp to talk to developers. No more emails.

Updated dev portal: "Choose your own adventure"

## APIs for Reporting, Metrics, etc

S&P index churn, was avg 64 years... now avg 12 years

> Teams should expose their data, or be fired - Bezos, **Amazon**

$2.3 Trillion Global IT spending.  $500 Billion toward API-related

Most $ in ETL/Data Warehouse. Single "source of truth". 

* central bottleneck
* does not scale 

**Resource Oriented Architechture (ROA)***

Uniform data layers

SOA represents "actions". ROA represents "state"

Database content as HTTP Resource - "/db" auto makes hyperlinks directly to data

### Best practices

* R in REST - json not the only format
* URL should be easy 

Data Science process: acquire, store, discovery, learning, predicitive analysis

slashDB combines disparate data sources, creates data API and cache

### Searchable APIs

* users know what they want, don't know where to look
* make API hyperlink search engine friendly

## 6 Steps for API program success (so far...)

Capital One APIs power flagship apps across all platforms

1. Make it a priority
	* You need buy in. From real executives
2. Think Big. Tell Big Stories.
3. Create Buy-in.
	* Not just consumers, but also devs building it
4. Organize APIs as Products
5. Invest Heavily in the best tools (and build them when needed)
6. Prepare for a transition
	* You want to move and get ppl on board, but you find people not on board. Be mindful of gap.
	
> Whoever tells the best story gets the funding and attention
