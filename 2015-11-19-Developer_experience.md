## Tools and Techniques - Empowering Web Api consumers

Overall goal: Utility Belt

* Great Documentation
	* Not just what my api does
	* include use cases, demos, tutorials, getting started
* Open Source
* API Console - explore api w/o writing code

### Command line tools

* httpie

### Communication - is key

* Asking questions well

Consumer/Developer success

## API Documentation - Kelly Hitchcock

"Why developers hate your API" - Documentation sucks
"12 reasons your API sucks" - Documentation

The better your API design is, the easier to doc

Cosistent design and structure throughout docs

### Content Model

Defines each piece of content and where it fits

Be Language agnostic

Usable Code Samples

Token Replacements - common content

Flexible output - PDF? Paper?

More than a reference

## Developer Tools for Docs

ReadMe.io

Docs is the UI for your API

* Difficulties
	* Starting is hard
	* easy to forget things
	* English is ambiguous

* The problem with reference guides
	* making it look like Stripes docs doesn't means it's as good.

Pollyanna Principle  - machines work, people think

4 types of docs - Reference, Examples, Guides, Support

References = machine generated

Examples = half machine, half human

Guides = half human, half community

Support = Community

* What's wrong with documentation
	* O'reilly-ification of docs.  very generic and static.

Api Ecosystem

### Onboarding Flow

* Learn about person - language, name, etc
* Installation - requirements, api key
* MVC - minimum viable call, easiest way to get started
* Next Steps - use cases

Interactive Playgrounds - docs in disguise 

API sdks

API Status in docs - badge in the header, etc
