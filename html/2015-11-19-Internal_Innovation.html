<p>Innovation is not a well-oiled machine</p>
<p>Innovation is like an ant colony, looking chaotic from the outside</p>
<p>&quot;Managers of the most effective teams encourage adaptive ant colony behavior, less effective demand abiding by rigid rules&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditions to foster innovation
<ul>
<li>Powerful central mission, but loose central structure
<ul>
<li>Steve Urban from Netflix: &quot;Neither time nor desire to micromanage or make technical decisions for my team&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frequent interaction to maximize learning
<ul>
<li>Only sustainable competitive advantage is the org's ability to learn faster than others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Constant experimentation
<ul>
<li>If everything we do succeeds, we're failing because we're not taking enough risk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Freedom to look for next horizon</li>
