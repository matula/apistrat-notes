<p>Consumer APIS vs Business APIs. Business APIs are more difficult to get adoption.</p>
<p>Nordstrom - using APIs as a business strategy (see Harvard Business Review)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Persistent digitalization of Nordstrom business allowed revenue growth more than 50%&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-you-cant-get-there">Why you can't get there</h3>
<ul>
<li>can't allow the time to make it mature</li>
<li>every part of the org, all teams are in the API business</li>
</ul>
<p>APIs are gateway to next-gen tech</p>
<ul>
<li>mobile</li>
<li>IoT</li>
<li>big data</li>
</ul>
<p>currently, 10-12 thousand of open APIs</p>
<p>Every non-trivial object is about to get an API</p>
<p>Business of API is major force. Expedia, 90% of rev from API. Ebay, 60%. Amazon, 8% but half of total profit.</p>
<p>API business models have matured.</p>
<ul>
<li>developer pays - AWS, Paypal</li>
<li>developer gets paid - Revshare, affiliate</li>
</ul>
<p>APIS have led to most complex operation landscape in tech history</p>
<p>API space will become highly competative in the near future. Still open today.</p>
<p>&quot;low code&quot; enabled by simple APIs. ie IFTTT.</p>
<p>APIs enable citizen developers. Will probably be the lion share of API usage</p>
<h3 id="next-36-months">next 36 months</h3>
<ul>
<li>10 to 100 times more data and apps</li>
<li>10 times of experiments to win, 100 time to own industry</li>
<li>5-10 times more integration - enable citizen devs</li>
<li>You can't do it yourself - talk to customer</li>
<li>Let the &quot;developer network&quot; do the work. Listen to devs/consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're in the &quot;cave painting&quot; days of APIs. A great future ahead.</p>
