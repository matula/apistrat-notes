# Internal Innovation with APIs

Use the success in one department to inspire projects in other depts.

## Taking Your APIs Out In Public

* Steps to make APIs socially acceptable
	* 1) Start with Why?
		* People don't buy **what** you do, they buy **why** you do it
		* Golden Circle:  Why -> How -> What
	* 2) Dress For Success
		* You get 1 chance to make a first impression
		* How is your API presented? Who is your target?
	* 3) Check your zipper
		* Make sure you know what's exposed and when
	* 4) Find your safe place
		* Know your API limits and plan accordingly
		* People will do things you don't expect.  Sandbox
	* 5) Have a Plan
		* You built it... now what?
		

Once your API is outside your walls... it is a product.


## Fostering Innovation - Mike Amundsen

Innovation is not a well-oiled machine

Innovation is like an ant colony, looking chaotic from the outside

"Managers of the most effective teams encourage adaptive ant colony behavior, less effective demand abiding by rigid rules"

* Conditions to foster innovation
	* Powerful central mission, but loose central structure
		* Steve Urban from Netflix: "Neither time nor desire to micromanage or make technical decisions for my team"
	* Frequent interaction to maximize learning
		* Only sustainable competitive advantage is the org's ability to learn faster than others
	* Constant experimentation
		* If everything we do succeeds, we're failing because we're not taking enough risk
	* Freedom to look for next horizon

> If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea. - Antoine de Saint-Exupery
